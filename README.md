# School-Substitution-Plan
Python Project (31.12.2020)

The main functionality of this application is the webscraping of my former school website. The primary use was the procurement of the substitution plan  data. The data mainly consisted of changes in course, and was updated daily. Aditionally, I implemented a widget function for IOS within the app Pyton. With the help of IOS shortcuts I was able to run the programm once a day. The biggest challange was to bypass the login function due to the lack of knowledge I had in python at that time. Unfortunately, I can not use the app anymore because my login data is expired.
